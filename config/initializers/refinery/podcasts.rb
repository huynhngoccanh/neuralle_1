We do this by interviewing unique individuals that have included; Venture Capitalists, Bodybuilders, Hedge Fund Managers, Political Activists, Comedians, Tech Founders, Chefs, Rappers, and Restaurateurs to name just a few.
Our style is conversational, 1on1, and can go from 45 minutes to 2 hours long. Iâ€™m inspired by the likes of Tim Ferriss, Joe Rogan, Charlie Rose, Oprah Winfrey & Charlie Munger. In particular, Charlie Munger inspired me to create this podcast and help you build your wordly wisdom.
